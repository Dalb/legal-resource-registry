   .. notes::

      *Citation Form:* Prior to West NRS in 1875, in nominative
      reporters (Dallas 1790-1800, Cranch 1801-1815, Wheaton
      1816-1827, Peters 1828-1842, Howard 1843-1860, Black
      1861-1862, & Wallace 1863-1874); each nominative later given
      a backdated official "United States Reports" citation as
      well. Each nominative will thus have a U.S. Reports volume
      number, the U.S. abbreviated reporter name, a nominative
      volume number, an abbreviated nominative name, a page number
      for beginning of case, if needed, pinpoint page cites (the
      page numbers in the nominatives and the backdated US Reports
      are the same), and finally the year of decision in
      parentheses.

      In addition there are other unofficial print reporters that are
      frequently cited, so each case will have a separate citation
      string comprising that reporter's volume number, the abbreviated
      reporter name, a first page for the case in that reporter, as
      well as any pinpoint citations, followed by the year of decision
      in parentheses.

      **Circuit Justice Opinions**


      Circuit Justices are U.S. Supreme Court justices siting not as
      the Supreme Court, but as either the Circuit Justice overseeing
      one of the Federal Judicial Circuits, or sitting as an
      intermediate appellate judge in one of the Courts of Appeals, or
      sitting as a trial judge in one of the District Courts.

      Citations are to the same sources as opinions of the
      U.S. Supreme Court, if therein, or to the reporters for the
      Courts of Appeals or District Courts, if therein. If in all of
      these, the last name of the justice, followed by ", Circuit
      Justice" is put in the date parenthetical before the year of
      decision. If the justice is sitting in a lower court, the
      comma-separated abbreviated court name is inserted before the
      year of decision as well.

      **Circuit Courts of Appeal**

      Operational: 1891 to present

      The title for the numbered circuits from 1891 to
      1948 is: United States Court of Appeals for the XX Circuit.

      The title for the numbered circuits from 1948 is: United
      States Circuit Court of Appeals for the XX Circuit

      1891 Act created 9 circuits; 10th Circuit added 1929 (out of
      the 8th Circuit); the D.C. Circuit was added 1942 (Congress
      recognized the Court of Appeals of DC, established 1893, as a
      Circuit); 11th Circuit added 1980 (out of the 5th Circuit);
      the Federal Circuit added 1982 (from the old US Court of
      Customs and Patent Appeals and the appellate jurisdiction of
      the US Court of Claims); currently 11 numbered geographical
      circuits, the DC Circuit, & the Federal Circuit.

      *Citation Form:* volume number, reporter abbreviation [to
      the Federal Reporter (v. 1-300, 1880-1924); Federal Reporter,
      2d Series (v. 1-999, 1924-1993); or Federal Reporter, 3d
      Series (v. 1-current, 1993-present)], a first page for the
      case in that reporter, as well as any pinpoint citations,
      followed by a string in parentheses containing the
      abbreviated court name, in this case, the circuit a comma,
      and the year of decision. Since 2001, some "unpublished"
      decisions are being published unofficially in a West
      reporter, the Federal Appendix. Their citations conform to
      published opinions.

      **United States Circuit Courts**

      Operational: 1789 to 1912

      Trial courts for diversity suits and major federal crimes;
      appellate jurisdiction over the District Courts

      1 for each Federal Judicial District in theory; some
      districts did not have them because they were either too
      difficult for circuit-riding justices to reach or were new
      states for which Congress had not yet established a circuit
      court

      From 1789 to 1880, published by private publishers as
      nominative reporters, later collected by West and published
      as "Federal Cases" (analogous to the English Reports). From
      1880 to 1912, published in the Federal Reporter. The older
      cases will have nominative volume number, abbreviated
      reporter title, first page, pinpoints (if any), a Federal
      Cases volume number, the abbreviated reporter, and the
      page/pinpoints in that reporter, followed by a parenthetical
      string with a Federal Judicial District Circuit Court name
      abbreviation and year of decision, followed by another
      parenthetical string with the Federal Cases case
      number. Cases after 1880 will just have the Federal Reporter
      volume, abbreviated reporter name, first page/pinpoints, ,
      followed by a parenthetical string with a Federal Judicial
      District Circuit Court name abbreviation and year of
      decision.

      **United States District Courts**

      Operational: 1789 to present

      1 for each Federal Judicial District

      From 1789 to 1880, published by private publishers as
      nominative reporters, later collected by West and published
      as "Federal Cases" (analogous to the English Reports). From
      1880 to 1932, published in the Federal Reporter. From 1932 to
      present, published in the Federal Supplement (v. 1-999,
      1932-1998), Federal Supplement, Second Series (v. 1-current,
      1998 to present). Some cases only published in more
      specialized reporters: Federal Rules Decisions (1940 to
      present); West's Bankruptcy Reporter (1979 to present); or
      the Federal Rules Service (v. 1-25, 1938-1958), Federal Rules
      Service, Second Series (v. 1-40, 1958-1985), or Federal Rules
      Service, Third Series (v. 1-current, 1985 to present).  The
      older cases will have nominative volume number, abbreviated
      reporter title, first page, pinpoints (if any), a Federal
      Cases volume number, the abbreviated reporter, and the
      page/pinpoints in that reporter, followed by a parenthetical
      string with a Federal Judicial District name abbreviation and
      year of decision, followed by another parenthetical string
      with the Federal Cases case number. Cases from 1880 to 1932
      will just have the Federal Reporter volume, abbreviated
      reporter name, first page/pinpoints, , followed by a
      parenthetical string with a Federal Judicial District name
      abbreviation and year of decision. Most cases after 1932 will
      have the Federal Supplement/F.Supp.2d volume, abbreviated
      reporter name, first page/pinpoints, , followed by a
      parenthetical string with a Federal Judicial District name
      abbreviation and year of decision. For cases only published
      in the more specialized reporters, such as the Federal Rules
      Decisions, Federal Rules Service, or West's Bankruptcy
      Reporter, those follow the same model as the Federal
      Supplement cases, with the exception of the various Federal
      Rules Service series, which also require the name of the
      publisher in the date parenthetical.

      **United States Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals**

      Operational: 1971 to 1993

      Same as United States Court of Appeals for the _
      Circuit. Citation is similar but with the abbreviated court
      name instead of the Circuit in the date parenthetical.

      **United States Emergency Court of Appeals**

      Operational: 1942 to 1962

      Same as United States Court of Appeals for the _
      Circuit. Citation is similar but with the abbreviated court
      name instead of the Circuit in the date parenthetical.

   .. notes::

      The following courts need separate entries

      **United States Commerce Court**

      Operational: 1910 to 1913

      Not really sure if this is an Art. III or Art. I court. The
      judges were appointed for a term of years, but were also
      simultaneously appointed to Circuit Courts of Appeals, which
      were Art. III appointments.)

      Same as United States Court of Appeals for the _
      Circuit. Citation is similar but with the abbreviated court
      name instead of the Circuit in the date parenthetical.

      **United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court**

      Operational: 1978 to present

      Judges are Art. III judges designated by the Chief Justice of
      the United States to serve for fixed, non-renewable terms.

      Not reported in any reporter. Redacted unclassified opinions
      are available in PDF on the Court's website.

      **United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review**

      Operational: 1978 to present

      Judges are Art. III judges designated by the Chief Justice of
      the United States to serve for fixed, non-renewable terms.

      may be available in PDF on the Court's website.

      **United States Court of Claims**

      Operational: 1863 to 1982

      Art. III court (after 1956, prior to that was an Art. I
      court) that had both original and appellate jurisdiction. In
      1982, the appellate jurisdiction was transferred to the new
      Federal Circuit, and the original jurisdiction was
      transferred to the new United States Claims Court, which in
      1992 became the United States Court of Federal Claims.

      Citations are to the Federal Reporter, Second Series
      \(v. 276-692, 1960 to 1982), Federal Supplement (v. 1-181,
      1932-1960), or the Court of Claims Reports (1863-1982).
