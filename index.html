<h1>An Editable Archive of Law-Making Institutions and Publishing Channels</h1>
<p>This archive contains structured descriptions of legal resources and
the publications from which they can be obtained. To view the
descriptions for a given resource and jurisdiction, follow the links
below.</p>
<p>The Registry is extensible: any visitor can propose the addition of
institutions, reporting services, or entire national
jurisdictions. Proposals must be accepted by the editors of the
Registry, and may be modified following discussion. To propose an
addition or amendment, click on the link for a given resource in any
Registry page, and follow the instructions provided in the source-code
view.</p>
<p>As of this writing (November 22, 2014) the Registry is an early work
in progress.  The content presented here should not be relied upon for
accuracy, nor should systems be built on top of it. (When the archive
is ready for action, this notice will be removed.)</p>
