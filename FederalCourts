In addition there are other unofficial print reporters that are frequently cited, so each case will have a separate citation string comprising that reporter's volume number, the abbreviated reporter name, a first page for the case in that reporter, as well as any pinpoint citations, followed by the year of decision in parentheses. The other reporters are:

 - West's Supreme Court Reporter (1893 to present)

 - United States Law Week (1933 to present)

Circuit Justice Opinions
-
(Circuit Justices are U.S. Supreme Court justices siting not as the Supreme Court, but as either the Circuit Justice overseeing one of the Federal Judicial Circuits, or sitting as an intermediate appellate judge in one of the Courts of Appeals, or sitting as a trial judge in one of the District Courts.)
**Print:** Citations are to the same sources as opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court, if therein, or to the reporters for the Courts of Appeals or District Courts, if therein. If in all of these, the last name of the justice, followed by ", Circuit Justice" is put in the date parenthetical before the year of decision. If the justice is sitting in a lower court, the comma-separated abbreviated court name is inserted before the year of decision as well.
