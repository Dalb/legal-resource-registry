      the Federal Reporter (v. 1-300, 1880-1924); Federal Reporter,
      2d Series (v. 1-999, 1924-1993); or Federal Reporter, 3d

      followed by a string in parentheses containing the
      abbreviated court name, in this case, the circuit a comma,
      and the year of decision. Since 2001, some "unpublished"
      decisions are being published unofficially in a West
      reporter, the Federal Appendix. Their citations conform to
      published opinions.

      **United States Circuit Courts**

      Operational: 1789 to 1912

      Trial courts for diversity suits and major federal crimes;
      appellate jurisdiction over the District Courts

      1 for each Federal Judicial District in theory; some
      districts did not have them because they were either too
      difficult for circuit-riding justices to reach or were new
      states for which Congress had not yet established a circuit
      court

      From 1789 to 1880, published by private publishers as
      nominative reporters, later collected by West and published
      as "Federal Cases" (analogous to the English Reports). From
      1880 to 1912, published in the Federal Reporter. The older
      cases will have nominative volume number, abbreviated
      reporter title, first page, pinpoints (if any), a Federal
      Cases volume number, the abbreviated reporter, and the
      page/pinpoints in that reporter, followed by a parenthetical
      string with a Federal Judicial District Circuit Court name
      abbreviation and year of decision, followed by another
      parenthetical string with the Federal Cases case
      number. Cases after 1880 will just have the Federal Reporter
      volume, abbreviated reporter name, first page/pinpoints, ,
      followed by a parenthetical string with a Federal Judicial
      District Circuit Court name abbreviation and year of
      decision.

      **United States District Courts**

      Operational: 1789 to present

      1 for each Federal Judicial District

      From 1789 to 1880, published by private publishers as
      nominative reporters, later collected by West and published
      as "Federal Cases" (analogous to the English Reports). From
      1880 to 1932, published in the Federal Reporter. From 1932 to
      present, published in the Federal Supplement (v. 1-999,
      1932-1998), Federal Supplement, Second Series (v. 1-current,
      1998 to present). Some cases only published in more
      specialized reporters: Federal Rules Decisions (1940 to
      present); West's Bankruptcy Reporter (1979 to present); or
      the Federal Rules Service (v. 1-25, 1938-1958), Federal Rules
      Service, Second Series (v. 1-40, 1958-1985), or Federal Rules
      Service, Third Series (v. 1-current, 1985 to present).  The
      older cases will have nominative volume number, abbreviated
      reporter title, first page, pinpoints (if any), a Federal
      Cases volume number, the abbreviated reporter, and the
      page/pinpoints in that reporter, followed by a parenthetical
      string with a Federal Judicial District name abbreviation and
      year of decision, followed by another parenthetical string
      with the Federal Cases case number. Cases from 1880 to 1932
      will just have the Federal Reporter volume, abbreviated
      reporter name, first page/pinpoints, , followed by a
      parenthetical string with a Federal Judicial District name
      abbreviation and year of decision. Most cases after 1932 will
      have the Federal Supplement/F.Supp.2d volume, abbreviated
      reporter name, first page/pinpoints, , followed by a
      parenthetical string with a Federal Judicial District name
      abbreviation and year of decision. For cases only published
      in the more specialized reporters, such as the Federal Rules
      Decisions, Federal Rules Service, or West's Bankruptcy
      Reporter, those follow the same model as the Federal
      Supplement cases, with the exception of the various Federal
      Rules Service series, which also require the name of the
      publisher in the date parenthetical.
