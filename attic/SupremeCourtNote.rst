      *Citation Form:* Prior to West NRS in 1875, in nominative
      reporters (Dallas 1790-1800, Cranch 1801-1815, Wheaton
      1816-1827, Peters 1828-1842, Howard 1843-1860, Black
      1861-1862, & Wallace 1863-1874); each nominative later given
      a backdated official "United States Reports" citation as
      well. Each nominative will thus have a U.S. Reports volume
      number, the U.S. abbreviated reporter name, a nominative
      volume number, an abbreviated nominative name, a page number
      for beginning of case, if needed, pinpoint page cites (the
      page numbers in the nominatives and the backdated US Reports
      are the same), and finally the year of decision in
      parentheses.

      In addition there are other unofficial print reporters that are
      frequently cited, so each case will have a separate citation
      string comprising that reporter's volume number, the abbreviated
      reporter name, a first page for the case in that reporter, as
      well as any pinpoint citations, followed by the year of decision
      in parentheses.

      **Circuit Justice Opinions**


      Circuit Justices are U.S. Supreme Court justices siting not as
      the Supreme Court, but as either the Circuit Justice overseeing
      one of the Federal Judicial Circuits, or sitting as an
      intermediate appellate judge in one of the Courts of Appeals, or
      sitting as a trial judge in one of the District Courts.

      Citations are to the same sources as opinions of the
      U.S. Supreme Court, if therein, or to the reporters for the
      Courts of Appeals or District Courts, if therein. If in all of
      these, the last name of the justice, followed by ", Circuit
      Justice" is put in the date parenthetical before the year of
      decision. If the justice is sitting in a lower court, the
      comma-separated abbreviated court name is inserted before the
      year of decision as well.
